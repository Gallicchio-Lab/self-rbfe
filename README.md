# self-rbfe
## The input-atm directory 
Includes inputs - protein, ligands and complexes directory for an ATM self-rbfe run 

## The input-atm-metaD directory
Includes inputs - protein, ligands and complexes containing the bias potential for the torsions of the ligand for an ATM-metaD self-rbfe run 

## metaD
Includes directories of the ligands for simulation in solution with the metadynamics (also contains the collected bias potential)

## torsional-rest
Includes torsional restraints .cntl in every ligand directory, with the atoms and values of the torsions and their tolerance.
