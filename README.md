# self-RBFE + torsional Metadynamics

AToM-OpenMM input files for the calculations reported in the paper: [What to Make of Zero: Resolving the Statistical Noise from Conformational Reorganization in Alchemical Binding Free Energy Estimates with Metadynamics Sampling](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c01250)

## atm 
Includes inputs - protein, ligands, and complexes for ATM self-RBFE runs.

## atm-metaD 
Includes inputs - protein, ligands and complexes for ATM self-RBFE runs with metadynamics-derived torsional biasing potentials. 

## metaD
Includes simulation input files for the metadynamics calculations in solution to obtain the torsional flattening biasing potentials (it contains the collected bias potentials as  well).

## delta-G-reorg
Includes control files and structure inputs of the complexes with torsional restraints to calculate ligand reorganization free energies.
